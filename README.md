# Empowering Image Prediction
November 2023

# Overview
Welcome to the "Empowering Image Prediction" project! This project is designed to predict images utilizing computer vision models and incorporating transfer learning techniques to enhance model performance.

Features
- Computer Vision Models: The project leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models to analyze and predict the content of images.

- Transfer Learning Techniques: Transfer learning is employed to take advantage of pre-trained models, enhancing the overall performance of the image prediction system.

# Model Training
If you want to retrain the model or fine-tune it for specific tasks, follow the steps in the train_model.ipynb notebook.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you have suggestions, bug reports, or want to add new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
